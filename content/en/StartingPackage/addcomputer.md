To add a computer to the network, you need to open a ticket with the IT services. To this end, [write them an email](mailto:support@lkb.upmc.fr).

The email must feature the info
- User last and first names :
- Login (typically your lkb email address) :
- Mac address of the device :
- Does this machine belong to the lab or to you?
- Is this Mac address for the wireless or LAN network?:
- Type of machine (portable computer, tower, usb adapter):
- Description : Brand / model / operating system :
- Date of end of contract (for personnal portable computers only) :

**It's plain and simple, either you provide all this info at once or the IT services will joyfully be a pain.**

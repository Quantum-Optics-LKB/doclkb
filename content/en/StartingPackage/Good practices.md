## Lasers

In the lab rooms we use several lasers between 780nm and 860nm (NIR). These lasers are pumped by Coherent's Verdi laser shreding green light and can be monitored with their respective driver. Below we give an exhausitve explanation of the procedure you must follow between the moment you arrive un the lab room and the beginning of your experiments  

### Turn on pump lasers.

    1. Turn the key on the "on" position and wait until the current seeking displayed on the screen of the pump laser controller stabilize around a value.

    2. Press the button power level 1. The power value displayed on the screen of the controller represent the optical power the laser should provide. You can change it by turning the potentiometer on the controller. Depending on the laser you're using (V10 or V18) make sure this power setting does not exceed the maximum output power of the laser. 

    3. Press the buton "shutter" to open the shutter. Now you should see green laser light outcoming the cavity.




### Turn off pump lasers.

    1. Make sure the power value displayed on the controler screen is not set to his maximum value. In this case, lower the power at least 2W under the maximum value.  

    2. Press the button power level 1 to stop the cavity from lasing.   

    3. Close the shutter.  

    4. Wait for the current displayed on the screen to decrease and stabilize and then turn the key on the "off" position.

Don't forget to turn of the pump lasers when you're done.

### Good use of the lasers

To get the best performance of your laser you must make sure it is properly aligned. To do so, use a powermeter at the laser output and maximise the optical power by using the appropriate mirrors screws.

A laser properly aligned should provide your the best optical output power and stability both in intensity and frequency. 
Each laser of the lab room has is own driver that you need to turn on if you want to monitor your laser.

# Defect

  This lab book aims at consigning everything I do about the defect experiment.

## Recap of what I did up until this point 18/02/22

So far I replicated Guillaume's setup ![setup](tangui/images/defect_guillaume.png)

I added a BS after the first PBS and after the second to allow for both co and counter propagation and to monitor the phase of the fluid at the output.

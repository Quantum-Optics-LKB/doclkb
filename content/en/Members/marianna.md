# g2 experiment via microscope

  This document aims at explaining how the g2 set-up works. 

## Set-up description 

Here I will put soon the set-up description as reference for the next paragraph. 

## Launch the Spyder interface to control the set-up 

Open Spyder on the lab computer and run Experiment.guy, a 'Main Window' interface will appair. 

### Connection to the CCD camera 
We use the CCD camera to locate and select the emitters or to make saturation measures and bleaching video.
In the first case we control the CCD camera using the software, instead in the second case using 'Experiment.guy'. 
When you want to use the CCD camera's software for wide-field and confocal microscopy, we must check that the CCD camera is not controlled by Spyder. To do this, on the 'Main Window' interface open the 'Devices' panel from the top bar and then disconnect 'Camera' on the list that appears on the right. 

## Wide-field microscopy 

We use a non collimated LED lamp at 400 nm to excite the sample in order to have an overview of the all camera's frame and select one emitter. The LED power can be adjusted between 0 and 25W (0% - 100%) and we choose the LED power according to the nature of the emitters we are characterizing (i.e for perovskites we set the power at 2.5W (10%), for brighter emitters 5% can be enough). 

Then we open the Camera's software 


## Confocal microscopy 

## Spectra acquisition 

## Saturation measurement 

## Bleaching video acquisition 

## Blueshift measurement 

## g2 measurement 

## Polarization measurement 

# Deposition of the emitter on the nanofiber

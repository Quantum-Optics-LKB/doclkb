## Introduction
This setup was built with the idea of being able to perform just about any fluid of light experiment.It is very visual and generally gives a clear picture of the physical phenomena being studied.  
It is quite quick to learn but requires some knowledge of how to control the electronic and optical devices.  
After that it will be possible, thanks to our SLM, to do many different experiments very quickly.

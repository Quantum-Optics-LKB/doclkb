## Turbulence gain measurement
  Use the code to control the piezo devices  to chenge the position pf probe beam.

## Problems should be solved 
   
   How to avoid the air fluctuance?


## Task list
- [x] For each point we move randomly a little the piezo and get 10 maxima and average to have the real value (and avoid phase fluctuation)
- [x] Measure power law as function of random noise added on the slm

## Bibliogrpahy

A page to find relevant papers to understand what you do. All of the references (unless if otherwise stated) are available on [**Zotero**](/StartingPackage/Tools#zotero).

### Bogoliubov theory

In this section, we will give useful references to treat the cubic hamiltonian of the non linear propagation in a $\chi^{(3)}$ medium.\
These paper describe how to treat your system in second quantized formalism, using field operators ($\hat{a}$ and $\hat{a}^\dagger$). If you are not familiarized with these tools, we strongly suggest you take a look at any serious quantum mechanics book (such as *Quantum Field Theory for the gifted amateur* by Lancaster and Blundell).

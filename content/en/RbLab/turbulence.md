## Turbulence gain measurement
   *Experimental theory*
   <alert type="warning">Don't abtain lots of data and then average them.</alert>
   <alert type="danger">Don't make the power too high to avoid damage the SLM.</alert>
  Use the code to control the piezo devices  to chenge the position pf probe beam.

## Problems should be solved 
   
   How to avoid the air fluctuance?

## Task list
- [x] For each point we move randomly a little the piezo and get 10 maxima and average to have the real value (and avoid phase fluctuation)
- [x] Measure power law as function of random noise added on the slm

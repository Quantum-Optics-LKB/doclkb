## Open-flow cryostat cooling procedure

---

1. **Pumping of the cryostat**
    1. Open the inlet valve of the cryostat
    2. Launch the Pascal vacuum pump: the pressure should reach ~ **5x10^-2 mbar**
    3. Launch the turbo pump (0 -> 25000 rpm): final pressure ~ **9x10^-4 mbar**
    <alert type="danger">Do not launch the turbo pump if the vacuum is greater than 5x10^-2</alert>

2. **Injection of the helium rod into the dewar**
    1. Close the dewar outlet valve
    2. Connect the Jussieu pipe to the rod
    3. Put the rod on the dewar entrance
    4. Tighten the joint in order to lock the rod 
        <alert type="danger">The rod doesn't must fall too fast inside the dewar</alert>
    5. Open the dewar inlet valve
    6. Let the rod slides gently against the joint, adjust the tightening to adjust its speed
        <alert type="danger">The rod speed must be regular to not create ice that would block the circulation</alert>
    7. The dewar pressure MUST increase to 5mbar in order to initiate the helium flow inside the cryostat
        <alert type="danger">Do not let the pressure exceed 5mbar, open the outlet valve to decrease it</alert>  
    8. Reach the bottom of the dewar

3. **Connection to the cryostat**
    1. Insert the cold finger of the helium rod inside the cryostat 
    2. Launch the motorized circulation and open the flow regulation valve to its maximum
    3. Slightly raise the helium rod in the dewar
        <alert type="warning">Adjust the dewar position to reduce the pressure in the cryostats if it is greater than 3x10^-3mbar</alert>
    <alert type="success">The cryostat temperature should fall to 3.8K in 5 minutes</alert>

4. **Self-sustained helium circulation**
    <alert type="success">Useful to eliminate the vibrations due to the motorized circulation. The pressure in the dewar should be at least equal to 4mbar in order to feed the helium circulation</alert>
    1. Once the temperature in the cryostat is stabilized, switch off the motorized circulation
    2. Wait again for the temperature stabilization
    3. Close progressively the regulation valve until the temperature icreases again
    4. If needed, cut the Pascal pump
